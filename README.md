My notes for my MBA study. Notes are recorded as markdown. Study questions are embedded with the notes using the microformat:

```
<!---
  <question>What is a blah?</question>
  <answer>It's a foo!</answer>
  
  <question>What is a foo?</question>
  <answer>It's a blah!</answer>
--->
```

The [codepen script](https://codepen.io/liammclennan/pen/oaXpya?editors=0010) then converts this repository to a CSV that can be imported by [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) study.
