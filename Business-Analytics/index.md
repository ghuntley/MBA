Business Analytics
==================

### Components of Business Analytics

* BI/IS
* Statistics
* Modelling and Optimization 

### Types of Analytics

* **Descriptive analytics** use data to understand the past and present and to support decisions. i.e. reporting
* **Predictive Analytics** use data to predict the future. E.g. will this complaint escalate to the ombudsman. Will this loan default?
* **Prescriptive Analytics** use optimizations to maximize or minimize some value. E.g. Evaluating a load application. What is most profitable way to cut a cow? What pricing will maximize profit?

**Price elasticity** The extent to which price affects demand. 

### Models

Abstraction that captures the most important features of a system and presents them in a form that is easy to interpret. 

Models may be descriptive, predictive or prescriptive (depending upon the output). 

A model is often a function that links some set of input variables to an output variable. 

A **Decision Model** is a model used to help make decisions. It may have three types of input:

1. Data (constants)
1. Uncontrollable variables (the weather, stock prices)
1. Decision variables. Controllable. (pricing, production quantities)
